## Changes Made

### 1. Assessment Submission Screen (`AssessmentSubmissionScreen.js`)
- Enhanced the `handleSubmit` function to:
  - Save videos locally using the offline storage utility
  - Show a green success popup with "Success" title when submission is successful
  - Provide clear feedback to the user about the submission status
  - Maintain proper error handling for network issues

### 2. Athlete Registration Screen (`AthleteRegistrationScreen.js`)
- Enhanced the `handleSubmit` function to:
  - Show a green success popup with "Success" title when registration is successful
  - Navigate directly to the assessment submission screen with the newly registered athlete pre-selected
  - Reset the form after successful registration

### 3. Firebase Service (`FirebaseService.js`)
- Updated the `createAssessment` function to:
  - Ensure proper default values for assessments (status, submissionDate)
  - Maintain consistency with the data structure expected by recent activities
