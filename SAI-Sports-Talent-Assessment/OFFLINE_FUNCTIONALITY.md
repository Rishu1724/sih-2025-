# Offline Sports Assessment Functionality

This document describes the offline capabilities implemented in the SAI Sports Talent Assessment application.

## Overview

The offline functionality allows users to perform sports assessments without an internet connection. All data is stored locally on the device and can be synchronized with the server when connectivity is restored.

## Key Features

### 1. Offline Video Recording
- Record assessment videos using the device camera
- Videos are saved locally to device storage
- No internet connection required during recording

### 2. Local Data Storage
- Test results stored in AsyncStorage
- Video files stored in device file system
- Metadata and performance data persisted locally

### 3. Simulated AI Analysis
- Offline AI service simulates analysis for demonstration
- Results based on video file properties
- Supports all assessment types (push-ups, sit-ups, vertical jump, shuttle run)

### 4. Data Management
- View storage usage statistics
- Clear offline data when needed
- Automatic cleanup of old files

## Implementation Details

### Services

#### OfflineAIService (`src/services/OfflineAIService.js`)
- Simulates AI/ML processing for sports assessments
- Generates mock analysis results based on video file properties
- Supports all assessment types with appropriate metrics

#### OfflineStorage (`src/utils/offlineStorage.js`)
- Manages local storage of test data and video files
- Handles file system operations for video storage
- Provides utilities for data management and cleanup

### Screens

#### VideoRecordingScreen (Modified)
- Saves videos locally for offline processing
- Integrates with OfflineAIService for analysis
- Shows offline processing status

#### TestResultScreen (Modified)
- Displays offline AI analysis results
- Falls back to mock data when offline analysis is not available
- Maintains consistent UI with online mode

#### OfflineTestScreen (`src/screens/tests/OfflineTestScreen.js`)
- Dedicated screen for testing offline functionality
- Shows storage information and capabilities
- Provides tools for data management

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User records assessment video
2. Video saved to local file system
3. Metadata stored in AsyncStorage
4. Offline AI service processes video (simulated)
5. Results displayed in TestResultScreen
6. Data synchronized with server when online

## Testing Offline Mode

To test the offline functionality:

1. Navigate to the Offline Testing screen
2. Verify initialization status
3. Check storage information
4. Run test analysis
5. Record a test video in offline mode
6. View results with simulated AI analysis

## Future Enhancements

### True Offline AI Processing
- Integrate TensorFlow Lite for real offline inference
- Convert Python models to mobile-compatible formats
- Implement native modules for performance optimization

### Enhanced Data Synchronization
- Automatic sync when connectivity is restored
- Conflict resolution for offline data
- Progress indicators for sync operations

### Improved Storage Management
- Automatic cleanup based on storage policies
- Compression of video files
- Selective sync options

## Dependencies

The offline functionality requires the following dependencies:
- `expo-file-system`: For file system operations
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: For local data storage
- `expo-camera`: For video recording (already in use)
- `expo-media-library`: For media management (already in use)

These dependencies are already included in the project's package.json.
