# Expo Tunnel Connection Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides solutions for the "Tunnel connection has been closed" error that occurs when using Expo with the `--tunnel` flag.

## Common Causes and Solutions

### 1. Package Version Mismatch (Already Fixed)
The warning about package versions can cause instability:
- expo@54.0.7 → 54.0.8
- expo-camera@17.0.7 → ~17.0.8
- expo-document-picker@12.0.2 → ~14.0.7
- expo-media-library@18.1.1 → ~18.2.0

This has been fixed in your package.json.

### 2. Network Connectivity Issues

#### Solution A: Restart the Development Server
1. Stop the current Expo process (Ctrl+C)
2. Run the command again:
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

#### Solution B: Use LAN Instead of Tunnel
Try using the LAN connection instead:
```bash
npx expo start --lan
```

#### Solution C: Check Your Internet Connection
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Try switching to a different network if possible

### 3. Firewall/Antivirus Interference

#### Windows Defender Firewall
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
3. Click "Change settings"
4. Find "Node.js" or "node.exe" and check both Private and Public networks
5. If not found, click "Allow another app" and add Node.js

#### Antivirus Software
- Temporarily disable your antivirus software to test
- Add an exception for Node.js and Expo processes

### 4. Ngrok Service Issues

#### Solution A: Check Ngrok Status
Visit https://status.ngrok.com/ to check for service outages

#### Solution B: Clear Expo Cache
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### 5. Port Conflicts

#### Solution A: Use Different Ports
Expo automatically uses port 8081, but you can specify a different port:
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel --port 8082
```

### 6. Alternative Development Approaches

#### Option 1: Use Expo Go App
1. Download Expo Go on your mobile device
2. Ensure your mobile device and computer are on the same network
3. Use the LAN option instead of tunnel:
```bash
npx expo start --lan
```

#### Option 2: Use Web Version
For testing purposes, you can use the web version:
```bash
npx expo start --web
```

## Recommended Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **First, try restarting the development server:**
```bash
# Stop current process with Ctrl+C
npx expo start --tunnel
```

2. **If that doesn't work, try the LAN option:**
```bash
npx expo start --lan
```

3. **Clear cache if issues persist:**
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

4. **Check your firewall settings** as described above

5. **Try a different network connection** if possible

## Prevention Tips

1. Keep Expo and related packages updated
2. Maintain a stable internet connection
3. Configure firewall properly for development tools
4. Consider using LAN instead of tunnel for better reliability

## When to Use Each Connection Type

| Connection Type | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------------|----------|------|------|
| Tunnel | Remote testing, sharing | Works from anywhere | Can be unstable |
| LAN | Local network testing | More stable | Requires same network |
| Local | Single device testing | Fastest | Only works locally |
