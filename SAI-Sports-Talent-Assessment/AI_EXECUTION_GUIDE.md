# AI Execution Guide for Assessment Types

## Overview

This guide explains how the AI analysis system works when an assessment type is selected in the Submit Assessment screen. Each assessment type triggers the execution of a specific Python script that performs computer vision analysis on the submitted video.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction Flow

1. **Select Assessment Type**: User selects an assessment type from the dropdown in the Submit Assessment screen
2. **Video Submission**: User uploads a video file
3. **Backend Processing**: When the assessment is submitted, the backend routes the video to the appropriate Python AI script
4. **AI Analysis**: The Python script analyzes the video and returns results
5. **Result Storage**: Results are stored in the database and displayed in the Test History

### 2. Assessment Type Mapping

| Assessment Type | Python Script | Analysis Performed |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Sit-ups | `situp_counter.py` | Counts sit-up repetitions using pose detection |
| Push-ups | `pushup.py` | Counts push-up repetitions using pose detection |
| Vertical Jump | `vertical_jump.py` | Measures jump height and counts attempts |
| Shuttle Run | `shuttle_run.py` | Counts shuttle run laps using movement tracking |

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Frontend (React Native)
- When an assessment type is selected, the app displays information about the AI analysis that will be performed
- The selected assessment type is sent to the backend with the video file

#### Backend (Node.js)
- The `assessments.js` route receives the submission
- The `aiAnalysisService.js` determines which Python script to execute
- The `ai_analysis_wrapper.py` acts as a bridge between Node.js and Python

#### Python AI Scripts
- Each script uses MediaPipe for pose detection
- Videos are analyzed frame by frame to count repetitions or measure performance
- Results are output as JSON for easy parsing

### 4. Detailed Workflow

1. **User selects assessment type**:
   - UI shows details about the selected assessment
   - Information about the AI analysis is displayed

2. **Video submission**:
   - Video is uploaded to the backend
   - Assessment record is created in the database

3. **AI processing initiation**:
   - Backend calls `aiAnalysisService.analyzeVideo()`
   - Service spawns a Python process with the appropriate script

4. **Python execution**:
   - Python script processes the video using MediaPipe
   - Results are output as JSON
   - Process returns results to Node.js

5. **Result storage**:
   - AI results are stored in the assessment record
   - Assessment status is updated

6. **User feedback**:
   - Results appear in Test History
   - Status indicators show processing progress

## Testing AI Execution

### Automated Testing
Run the test script to verify all AI scripts work correctly:
```bash
python test-ai-execution.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. In the mobile app:
   - Navigate to Submit Assessment
   - Select an assessment type
   - Upload a video
   - Submit the assessment
   - Check Test History for results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Python not found**:
   - Ensure Python 3 is installed and in PATH
   - Check that required packages are installed:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
     ```

2. **MediaPipe errors**:
   - Ensure system has required dependencies
   - Check Python version compatibility

3. **Video processing failures**:
   - Verify video format is supported
   - Check file permissions

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check backend logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for AI analysis messages
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test Python scripts directly**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/services
   python situp_counter.py path/to/test/video.mp4
   ```

3. **Verify wrapper execution**:
   ```bash
   python ai_analysis_wrapper.py path/to/video.mp4 sit-ups
   ```

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Time
- AI analysis typically takes 10-30 seconds depending on video length
- Processing happens asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI

### Resource Usage
- Python processes use significant CPU during analysis
- Videos are processed one at a time to manage resources

### Error Handling
- Failed analyses are retried automatically
- Results include error information for debugging
- Fallback to mock data if AI analysis fails

## Future Improvements

### Enhanced Analysis
- Add more detailed technique feedback
- Implement performance trend analysis
- Add comparison with benchmarks

### Performance Optimization
- Implement video preprocessing to reduce file size
- Add parallel processing for multiple videos
- Optimize MediaPipe configuration for speed

### Reliability Improvements
- Add more robust error handling
- Implement better retry mechanisms
- Add health checks for Python environment
