# CustomPicker Component Improvement

## Changes Made

The CustomPicker component has been enhanced to provide a proper dropdown functionality instead of cycling through options. 

### Previous Behavior
- Tapping the picker would cycle through options sequentially
- No proper dropdown interface was displayed
- Users couldn't see all available options at once

### New Behavior
- Tapping the picker now opens a modal with all available options
- Users can see all options in a scrollable list
- Users can select any option directly
- Visual indication of the currently selected option
- Proper modal design with header and close button

### Technical Implementation

1. Added React Native's Modal component to display options
2. Created a modal overlay with a semi-transparent background
3. Designed a scrollable list of options within the modal
4. Added visual feedback for the selected option
5. Implemented proper modal dismissal (tap outside or close button)

### Files Modified
- `src/components/CustomPicker.js` - Enhanced with modal functionality

### Usage
The component works exactly as before, but now provides a better user experience:

```jsx
<CustomPicker
  label="Select an option"
  value={selectedValue}
  onValueChange={setSelectedValue}
  items={[
    { label: 'Option 1', value: 'option1' },
    { label: 'Option 2', value: 'option2' },
    { label: 'Option 3', value: 'option3' }
  ]}
  placeholder="Choose an option..."
/>
```

### Testing
A test file `test-picker.js` has been created to demonstrate the functionality.

## Benefits
1. Improved user experience
2. Better accessibility
3. More intuitive interaction
4. Consistent with standard mobile UI patterns
