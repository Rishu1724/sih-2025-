# Profile Picture Functionality Removal

This document explains why and how the profile picture functionality was removed from the ProfileScreen component.

## Reason for Removal

The application was failing to bundle with the following error:

```
Unable to resolve "expo-image-picker" from "src\screens\profile\ProfileScreen.js"
```

Despite installing the package, the error persisted, preventing the application from starting. To ensure the app runs without errors, we decided to temporarily remove the profile picture functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Package Import
- Removed `import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';` from ProfileScreen.js

### 2. Removed Image Picker Functionality
- Replaced `handleProfilePictureChange` function with a simple alert
- Removed all image picker related code including:
  - Permission requests
  - Image picker launch
  - Image selection handling
  - Profile picture update logic

### 3. Updated UI
- Removed TouchableOpacity wrapper around avatar
- Removed camera icon overlay
- Simplified avatar display logic
- Removed photoURL state variable

### 4. Updated Data Handling
- Removed photoURL from editData state
- Removed photoURL from updateUser calls
- Simplified displayPhotoURL logic

### 5. Updated Styles
- Removed editAvatarOverlay style
- Adjusted avatarSection style to avatarContainer
- Removed marginBottom from avatar styles

## Impact

### What Still Works
- All other profile functionality remains intact
- User can still view and edit name, age, and phone
- Profile information is still fetched from Firestore
- Logout functionality works as expected

### What Was Removed
- Profile picture selection and update capability
- Camera icon overlay on avatar
- Touch functionality on avatar

## Future Considerations

To re-enable profile picture functionality:

1. Reinstall expo-image-picker:
   ```bash
   npm install expo-image-picker
   ```

2. Re-add the import statement:
   ```javascript
   import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';
   ```

3. Restore the original handleProfilePictureChange function

4. Re-add the TouchableOpacity wrapper and camera overlay

5. Restore photoURL state and update logic

This approach ensures the application runs without errors while maintaining all other functionality.
