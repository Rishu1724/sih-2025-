# Expo Image Picker Fix

This document explains the issue with the expo-image-picker package and how it was resolved.

## Issue Description

The application was failing to bundle with the following error:

```
Unable to resolve "expo-image-picker" from "src\screens\profile\ProfileScreen.js"
```

This error occurred because the `expo-image-picker` package was not properly installed or was missing from the project dependencies.

## Root Cause

The `expo-image-picker` package was referenced in the ProfileScreen.js file but was not available in the node_modules directory. This could be due to:

1. Missing package installation
2. Incorrect package version compatibility
3. Corrupted node_modules cache

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Package Installation

We verified and installed the correct version of expo-image-picker that is compatible with the current Expo version:

```bash
npm install expo-image-picker@~17.0.8
```

### 2. Cache Clearing

We cleared the Metro bundler cache to ensure that all dependencies are properly resolved:

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### 3. Port Management

Since port 8081 was already in use, we configured the development server to use port 8082 automatically.

### 4. Helper Scripts

We created several helper scripts to make it easier to start the development server:

1. `start-dev.js` - Interactive menu for choosing connection options
2. `start-expo-auto.js` - Automatically starts Expo with cache clearing on port 8082
3. `start-server.bat` - Windows batch file for starting the server

## Verification

The fix was verified by successfully starting the Expo development server without any bundling errors. The application should now be able to:

1. Import `expo-image-picker` without errors
2. Use the image picker functionality in the ProfileScreen
3. Run without the "Unable to resolve" error

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always ensure all required packages are listed in package.json
2. Regularly update packages to maintain compatibility
3. Clear cache when encountering bundling issues
4. Use the provided helper scripts for consistent startup

## Package Version Compatibility

The current package versions that are confirmed to work together:

- expo: 54.0.8
- expo-image-picker: ~17.0.8
- expo-camera: ~17.0.8
- expo-document-picker: ~14.0.7
- expo-media-library: ~18.2.0

These versions ensure compatibility and prevent bundling errors.
