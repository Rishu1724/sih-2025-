## Issue Description
The application was showing the following error:
```
ERROR Registration error: [ReferenceError: Property 'createAthlete' doesn't exist]
```

This error was preventing athlete registration in the SAI Sports Talent Assessment application.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging
- Added comprehensive logging to both AthleteRegistrationScreen and FirebaseService
- Added diagnostic functions to verify imports and function availability
- Added detailed error messages to help with debugging

### 2. Import Verification
- Verified that the import statement in AthleteRegistrationScreen.js is correct:
  ```javascript
  import { createAthlete } from '../../services/FirebaseService';
  ```
- Added runtime verification that [createAthlete](file:///c:/Users/rishu/OneDrive/Desktop/New%20folder/SAI-Sports-Talent-Assessment/src/services/FirebaseService.js#L23-L35) is properly imported as a function

### 3. FirebaseService Improvements
- Added detailed logging in the [createAthlete](file:///c:/Users/rishu/OneDrive/Desktop/New%20folder/SAI-Sports-Talent-Assessment/src/services/FirebaseService.js#L23-L35) function to track execution
- Enhanced error handling with stack traces
- Added diagnostic logging at module load and at the end of the file
