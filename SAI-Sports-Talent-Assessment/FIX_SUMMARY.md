# Fix Summary: Syntax Error in AssessmentSubmissionScreen.js

## Issue
There was a syntax error in `src/screens/assessments/AssessmentSubmissionScreen.js` at line 1025:
```
ERROR SyntaxError: C:\Users\rishu\OneDrive\Desktop\New folder\SAI-Sports-Talent-Assessment\src\screens\assessments\AssessmentSubmissionScreen.js: Unexpected token (1025:26)
```

## Root Cause
The `videoUploadButton` style object was missing its closing brace `}`. The object was defined as:

```javascript
videoUploadButton: {
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  borderWidth: 2,
  borderColor: Colors.lightGray,
  borderStyle: 'dashed',
```

But was missing the closing brace, causing a syntax error when the JavaScript parser encountered the next line.

## Fix Applied
Added the missing closing brace to properly close the style object:

```javascript
videoUploadButton: {
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  borderWidth: 2,
  borderColor: Colors.lightGray,
  borderStyle: 'dashed',
},
```

## Verification
The syntax has been verified and the file now parses correctly without any syntax errors.

## Impact
This fix resolves the Android bundling failure and allows the application to build and run properly.
