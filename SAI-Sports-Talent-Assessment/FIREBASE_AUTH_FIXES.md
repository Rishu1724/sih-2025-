# Firebase Auth and Media Library Warning Fixes

This document explains the warnings you're seeing in the console and how they've been addressed.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Firebase Auth AsyncStorage Warning

**Warning Message:**
```
You are initializing Firebase Auth for React Native without providing AsyncStorage. Auth state will default to memory persistence and will not persist between sessions.
```

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` package to the project
- Modified `src/config/firebase.js` to initialize Firebase Auth with proper persistence:

```javascript
import { initializeAuth, getReactNativePersistence } from 'firebase/auth';
import ReactNativeAsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

// Initialize Firebase Auth with AsyncStorage persistence
export const auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  persistence: getReactNativePersistence(ReactNativeAsyncStorage)
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Auth state now persists between app sessions
- User login status is maintained even after app restart
- Improved user experience with automatic login

### 2. Media Library Access Warning

**Warning Message:**
```
Due to changes in Androids permission requirements, Expo Go can no longer provide full access to the media library.
```

**Explanation:**
This is a limitation of Expo Go for security reasons. The app will still function correctly, but for full media library access, you would need to create a development build.

**Current Behavior:**
- Videos are still saved and accessible within the app
- Local storage using `expo-file-system` works correctly
- Offline functionality remains intact

**For Full Media Library Access:**
To get full media library functionality, create a development build:
```bash
npx expo build:android
# or
npx expo build:ios
```

### 3. FirebaseService Exports Logging

**Message:**
```
LOG  FirebaseService exports: {"createAssessment": "function", "createAthlete": "function", ...}
```

**Explanation:**
This is just informational logging to verify that all Firebase service functions are properly exported. It can be safely ignored or removed in production.

## Verification

To verify that the fixes are working:

1. **Auth Persistence Test:**
   - Log in to the app
   - Close and reopen the app
   - You should remain logged in (no need to log in again)

2. **Assessment Submission Test:**
   - Submit an assessment
   - Verify it appears in recent activities and test history
   - Close and reopen the app
   - The assessment data should still be visible

3. **Offline Functionality Test:**
   - Turn off network connection
   - Submit an assessment
   - It should be saved locally
   - When network is restored, data should sync properly

## Additional Notes

- The `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` package was already in your package.json
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Performance should be improved with proper auth state persistence
